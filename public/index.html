            There are four models, with a number of different versions to choose
            from.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Tesla Model S:</strong> The Model S originally launched in
              2012 and helped to put Tesla on the map as an automaker. Tesla has
              continued updating the Model S since its release, and the most
              recent model has two different versions: the Long Range and
              Performance, the Standard recently being dropped. The Model S is
              very much an executive saloon, with similar long and low design
              lines as you might find on a Jaguar.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tesla Model 3:</strong> The Model 3 launched in the US in
              2016 as the affordable alternative to the Model S, with prices now
              dropping to make it the most affordable Tesla. It is also
              available in the UK and across Europe. A four-door sedan, the
              Model 3 launched with a range of options, but that's been refined
              to just three that are currently available. Ranges are based on
              combined figures. Autopilot is standard, but the full self-driving
              upgrade is $5,500/£5,800.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Model X:</strong> Tesla's Model X is the soccer mom or
              dad's answer to the electric car. It's an SUV-style EV capable of
              seating seven people, but owes a lot of its design to the Model S,
              especially with that interior display. It uniquely features rear
              Falcon Wing doors (think the Delorean in Back to the Future) that,
              along with the huge touchscreen inside, will make all your kids
              think you bought a car from the future. There are two models, but
              three different seating configurations, with additional costs
              based on your choices for seats. Autopilot is included, the full
              self-driving upgrade option is $7,000/£5,900.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Model Y:</strong> The Tesla Model Y fills the space
              between the Model 3 and the Model X, as a compact SUV. It will
              seat seven, offer plenty of space, but really appeal to those
              looking for something more affordable. The compact SUV segment is
              the biggest selling at the moment and isn't hugely populated with
              electric models, so it's a key target for Tesla.
